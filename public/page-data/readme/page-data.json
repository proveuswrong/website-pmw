And curation is much better when there is no central party to trust because you know an item in the curated list is not curated because the curator got bribed.</p>\n<h3>Claims</h3>\n<p>Let's categorize claims according to two features:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Difficulty of finding a proof</li>\n<li>Difficulty of finding a counter-proof</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Easy to Prove</h4>\n<p>If you claim that 1+1=2, you can hardly find anyone to object to that. And actually, you can simply bring your proof with you and you leave nothing to chance. There is nothing to solve here.</p>\n<h4>Impossible to Debunk</h4>\n<p>God is real. Proof? Nah. Can you prove otherwise? Nope. It's not productive to debate on this.</p>\n<h4>Difficult or Impossible to Prove But Much Easier to Debunk Claims</h4>\n<p>This category is interesting. We encounter such claims everyday, on newsletters, Twitter and television. People claim things that they can't prove. And they use this as an excuse for not providing proof. At the same time anyone can find a counter-proof and debunk the claim, provided that there is incentive to do so, as this requires labor.</p>\n<p>A notable example is bug bounty programs. It's very difficult to prove that a piece of software is safe and secure so in order to gain the trust of the users, organizations issue bug bounty programs and invite everyone to prove that their software is not safe or not secure. After a significantly long time with a significantly big bounty, people start to become confident in this claim's chances to be true. At this point, the organization would argue that it's evident that there is no vulnerability, despite they can't prove it. This claim is not a truth at this point but it is a probabilistic truth with the likelihood of increasing every moment.</p>\n<h3>Should I Care?</h3>\n<p>You should care because this could be useful for a number of usecases.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug Bounties (explained above)</li>\n<li>News</li>\n<li>Advertisements</li>\n<li>Political Campaigns</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This project provides an effective way to gain trust of public.</p>\n<h2>How</h2>\n<h3>User Roles</h3>\n<h4>Claimer</h4>\n<p>They make claims and put bounties on them.</p>\n<h4>Challengers</h4>\n<p>They hunt claims down for bounties.</p>\n<h4>Readers</h4>\n<p>They consume distilled information.</p>\n<h3>Claim Lifecycle</h3>\n<p>TODO</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 04, 2019","slug":"/readme","title":"Prove Me Wrong"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"95ee4c7b-4ae2-563e-83cd-cbe2a3c47855","frontmatter__slug":"/readme","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"readme"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1870887160","3649515864"]}
